I&#39;ll be glad to collect some data. UrhoSharp isn&#39;t exactly popular, and the API has some omissions what make me think it&#39;s not much used in fact, I guess the HoloLens support is pretty much the only appeal there. Yeah, MG is really nice, the entry barrier is quite low not only because of nuget and VS templates but I guess the installer is somewhat useful too. I don&#39;t use MG these days though, I use FNA. MG has a somewhat big entry barrier in my opinion that&#39;s the content pipeline, and to make things worse they removed loading images directly from the API, so you have to get used to it to do the tutorials, which is another point that&#39;s not great in MG too since the XNA tutorials are getting less compatible each release, things like primitive drawing is already completely different and very hard to &#39;convert&#39; for a newbie. In terms of performance MG isn&#39;t great too, although it&#39;s surely getting better, especially in the new 3.6 (SDL2 and ditched OpenTK). MG is extremely popular though and has stuff that is important for most indies like IAP/Ads/etc, although I guess nothing keeps we from using these plugins (they&#39;re all Xamarin) in Atomic, but it&#39;s certainly not going to be as straightforward since the Xamarin stuff &#39;supports&#39; MG, they have tuts and CocosSharp (which sucks :P ). Luckily in terms of desktop maybe only Steamworks matters in terms of easy 3rd party lib and it&#39;s not an issue.</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>16:21:39</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td>A couple places for reference would be UrhoSharp, which has a nuget and some common ancestry: <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">https://github.com/xamarin/urho</a> also I think MonoGame does a pretty good job with nuget + VS templates... UrhoSharp also has templates I believe</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>16:19:22</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td><span data-link-type="mention" data-screen-name="Alan-FGR" class="mention">@Alan-FGR</span> If you were interested in looking at what it would mean to get Atomic into a nuget and usable by the XNA crowd, lemme know, I think you have a great eye there...</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>15:53:57</td><td>Alan-FGR</td><td><span data-link-type="mention" data-screen-name="JoshEngebretson" class="mention">@JoshEngebretson</span> well, that&#39;s what I always said! Stardew Valley was made I guess in XNA, which Atomic could surely replace perfectly! Maybe it could provide some functionality for people wanting to do stuff manually though like sprite batching and that kind of stuff, dunno... but nothing keeps people from using the ECS anyway. Regarding Slack, yep, no biggie. I&#39;m putting something together to help users with Gitter limitations. Only problem is I can&#39;t run server side python code in my server, but I&#39;ll try to go with JS and host on github, or maybe something like heroku could do but I&#39;ve never used it</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>15:15:44</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td>It needs to get easier to get started with and available in sdk format, like any tech, there&#39;s the short and long game</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>15:12:36</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td>or serious apps</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>15:12:29</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td>... and plenty of 3D games too</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>15:12:18</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td>A fair amount of effort has been spent on attracting &quot;users&quot; over the last few years.  Atomic is a currently a power tool in the right hands, as it continues to develop, will be more and more useful to general users, available as a nuget, simple JS distribution version, etc.   I do maintain that someone could make Stardew Valley with it in JS/TS, C#, or C++ right now</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>14:57:35</td><td>JoshEngebretson</td><td>I don&#39;t have a presence on Slack, I think that would get into joining private company slacks, for consulting etc... It is possible Slack is a better option for Atomic, though I don&#39;t think it is a limiting factor on people joining here... also, I <em>like</em> that GitHub accounts are used and integrated at the very top level of Gitter.  &quot;users&quot; are great, more interested in relationships with developers.  I really have little interest in being an engine provider, there are plenty of those already... more of a partner, for when you need or want to own your source code.</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>14:44:34</td><td>Alan-FGR</td><td><span data-link-type="mention" data-screen-name="JoshEngebretson" class="mention">@JoshEngebretson</span> also, I totally agree that anything of value should be captured into something permanent, that&#39;s why I really fancied that slack&lt;-&gt;discourse thing, but I&#39;m not sure if it works as I&#39;m expecting :P</td></tr><tr><td>2017-06-19<br>14:33:01</td><td>Alan-FGR</td><td><span data-link-type="mention" data-screen-name="JoshEngebretson" class="mention">@JoshEngebretson</span> Gitter isn&#39;t really dump friendly :laughing:, I&#39;m playing with the API but it&#39;s not easy to get the full history, it blocks you.

I&#39;ve most of GameWorks working flawlessly in AtomicNET (what&#39;s awesome, yay! :smile:). Build master (all) and start from there, to expose a field, use the files in the &quot;Generated&quot; folder of AtomicNETNative as a template, say for example you want to expose an int that&#39;s member of a scene, in Scene.h add:</p><pre><code>    <span class="keyword">int</span> x_;
    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">sxm</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">int</span> x)</span> </span>{ x_ = x; }
    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">gxm</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>{ <span class="keyword">return</span> x_; }</code></pre><p>Then, in CSModuleScene.cpp, add:</p><pre><code>ATOMIC_EXPORT_API void csb_Atomic_Scene_sxm(Scene* <span class="keyword">self</span>, <span class="keyword">int</span> x) { <span class="keyword">self</span>-&gt;sxm(x); }
ATOMIC_EXPORT_API <span class="keyword">int</span> csb_Atomic_Scene_gxm(Scene* <span class="keyword">self</span>) { <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">self</span>-&gt;gxm(); }</code></pre><p>Build AtomicNETNative.<br>To CSModuleScene.cs in AtomicNET.shproj, add thw following:</p><pre><code>[DllImport(Constants.LIBNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">csb_Atomic_Scene_sxm</span><span class="params">(IntPtr self, <span class="keyword">int</span> x)</span></span>;
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">sxm</span> <span class="params">(<span class="keyword">int</span> x)</span> </span>{ csb_Atomic_Scene_sxm(nativeInstance, x); }

[DllImport(Constants.LIBNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">csb_Atomic_Scene_gxm</span><span class="params">(IntPtr self)</span></span>;

An easy way to get it working is creating a new C# project in the editor and modifying it, point AtomicNETNative to the one you just build (don&#39;t forget to set it to copy if new on properties). Remove the AtomicNET projects that are setup by default, and if you wish you can add the AtomicNET project generated in the &quot;AtomicGameEngine\Artifacts\AtomicNET&quot; and add as dependency so it builds before your project and also it&#39;s easier for editing. You can also add the C++ projects (Atomic and AtomicNETNative) there, luckily Visual Studio allows you to have C++ and C# projects in the same solution what&#39;s really nice.<br>For default mashallings check the Pinvoke conversion table. You can pass complex types but that&#39;s out of the scope of this tutorial and you said you only need primitives anyway.<br>Don&#39;t count on the bindings generators to do crazy stuff for you, <span data-link-type="mention" data-screen-name="JoshEngebretson" class="mention">@JoshEngebretson</span> did an awesome job but they can&#39;t read your mind. Make your changes in a branch so you can easily rebase.<br>For a more complete bindings generator check SWIG, I&#39;ve been using it with great success, the modern versions (&gt;=3) are awesome, you don&#39;t even need an interface file, you just point it to your headers and it works almost perfectly.<br>Hope this helps somehow.
